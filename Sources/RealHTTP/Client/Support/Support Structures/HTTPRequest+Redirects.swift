/// - `default`:  Data tasks are intended for short, often interactive requests from your app to a server.
///               Data tasks can return data to your app one piece at a time after each piece of data is received,
///               or all at once through a completion handler.
///               Because data tasks do not store the data to a file, they are not supported in background sessions.
/// - `largeData`: Directly writes the response data to a temporary file.
///            It supports background downloads when the app is not running.
///            Download tasks retrieve data in the form of a file, and support background downloads while the app is not running.
